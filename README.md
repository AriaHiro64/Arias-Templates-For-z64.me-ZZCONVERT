Additional Templates for zzconvert

Before you complain please make sure

  Understand this isnt a "cool mod" repo but a template to modify

  You decompress your rom. Adding de/recompression to zzconvert is redundant.

  You have used the correct manifest for your purpose 

  This DOESNT work with normal 1.1/1.2 (out of the box).

  I realize it said 1.2 in the manifest but the debug rom is based on the 1.2 codebase

  If you see pink use the built in texture finder.

  Understand that 2.8 isnt supported quite yet.2.79 is best for oot for now.

  Understand that no piracy is and will be involved on my end. Buy what you modify.

  Understand the fbi isnt going to kick down your door over emulation software. Look up bleam.
