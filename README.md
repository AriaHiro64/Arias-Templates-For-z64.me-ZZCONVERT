If you didnt do dick to make these models dont try to claim them. other than that as long as you post your modification source,
read the gpl3, you should be ok to do what you please. theres not really a code of conduct but i will seperate this work from yours
if you do something nuts. Im not resposible for your behavior. Nor am I policing it. Dont film dead bodies or cause a race war 
and you should be fine.

If you are looking to use the skins all you need is the .zobj and manifest.txt files (usually aria's)
if you are looking to play around with the source files be my guest.
if you want yours added contact me pr make a pull request. (this requires posting the source files or I'm not accepting it)
